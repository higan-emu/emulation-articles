# byuu's emulator development resources

This website is an archived copy of byuu.net as it existed when it was closed on July 2020.
Since it contained a lot of useful information and wisdom
about the design and implementation of emulators,
the most important and useful information has been collected and preserved here.

This content has been manually converted to Markdown for ease of presentation;
if you find any conversion errors, please [file an
issue](https://github.com/byuu/byuu.net).

If you'd like to contribute an article of your own about some aspect of emulator
design or implementation, please [create a pull
request](https://github.com/byuu/byuu.net/pulls)!
